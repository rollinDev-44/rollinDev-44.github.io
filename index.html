            <p>
              The problem statement for out affinity diagram is that dining places on campus occassionally lose the order ticket of a student's meal.
              This causes students to potentially waste meal plan dollars and lose a meal. Our affinity diagram suggested 5 methods to solve this problem. 
              These methods are to cooperate with other companies, provide incentives to employees, offer digital solutions for the problem, notify the customers of errors with restuarants, 
              and have the customer provide suggestion to improve the quality of service.
